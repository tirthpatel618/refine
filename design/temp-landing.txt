Figure out Auth part later


FOR NOW:

The Full webiste is under maintenance. For now, you can still practice a bit and customize
- imo only cool rn if it has the sign up for updates. 

Features to allow: 

Customizable set. Post the customs to the backend, and then get questions from the backend 
Frontend will visualize them, validate if they are correct or not, and run the timer

Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage - for now 

Join email list as well. NO auth for now
