Figure out Auth part later


FOR NOW:

The Full webiste is under maintenance. For now, you can still practice a bit and customize
- imo only cool rn if it has the sign up for updates. 

Features to allow: 

Customizable set. Post the customs to the backend, and then get questions from the backend 
Frontend will visualize them,  and run the timer

Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, customs - for now 
Choose which thing you want to do:
Lets say addition, easy level
So then the route becomes GET questions/ with body {mode='addition', level=1}
Or subtraction custom min 78 max 890
so then route : GET questions/ with body {mode='subtraction', level=4, min=78, max=890}

Then the backend gens a batch of questions and sends them. 

Frontend runs timer and stores answers. Do it by id to make it easier? 
Sends a POST request to backend with questions/ {mode='addition', count={COUNT}}
and then the backend returns the correct amount

Join email list as well. NO auth for now 
Will fugure out this part later. not sure how to update from go to RDS. SHould it be frontend just sending it straight to the DB?
